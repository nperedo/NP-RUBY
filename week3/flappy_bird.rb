require 'gosu'
# Gosu is a lightweight 2D game development library for the Ruby programming language (and also usable in C++). It provides an easy way to:

# Open a game window and set up a main loop (update/draw).
# Draw shapes, images, and text on the screen.
# Play sounds and music.
# Handle input from the keyboard, mouse, or game controllers.


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Helper Methods
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These methods help us draw shapes in Gosu. They are defined as plain Ruby
# methods (not inside a class) because they do not need to store any state.
#

# Draw a filled rectangle on screen.
def draw_rect(x, y, width, height, color, z)
  Gosu.draw_quad(
    x,            y,            color,
    x + width,    y,            color,
    x + width,    y + height,   color,
    x,            y + height,   color,
    z
  )
end

# Draw a filled circle by drawing "triangles" around its center.
# segments is how many triangle "slices" we use to approximate a circle.
def draw_circle(cx, cy, radius, segments, color, z)
  angle_step = 2 * Math::PI / segments
  points = []

  # Collect points around a circle.
  segments.times do |i|
    angle = i * angle_step
    x = cx + Math.cos(angle) * radius
    y = cy + Math.sin(angle) * radius
    points << [x, y]
  end

  # Draw triangle slices from the center of the circle.
  segments.times do |i|
    x1, y1 = points[i]
    x2, y2 = points[(i + 1) % segments]  # Wrap around to the first point
    Gosu.draw_triangle(
      cx,  cy,  color,
      x1,  y1,  color,
      x2,  y2,  color,
      z
